I. What is Ant Training Academy (ATA)?

Bitmain has been keeping eyes on the dissemination of its product knowledge and the inheritance of technological capabilities since the establishment in 2013. Bitmain has been committed to enhancing the integral standard of the related personnel and promoting ecologically sustainable development in this field with its initial internal training and the ‘VIP Customers Maintenance Training’ launched in 2017.

‘Ant Training Academy’ is a training service upgrading project (hereinafter referred to as ‘Ant Academy’ or ‘Academy’) launched by Bitmain based on years of knowledge dissemination and technology inheritance and accumulation. It is the sole training institution and certification authority officially certified by Antminer. Currently, the core course of our academy is maintenance training, with its purpose of allowing more participants to further develop the skills needed in maintaining Antminers and later more training courses will be launched in accordance with various needs.

II. When does ATA begin?

ATA begins when the number of registered participants reaches 16 for each quarter of the year (Successful registrants will be set in accordance with payment order). The duration of each training period is two weeks.

Company Add: Building No.7, Pengcheng Logistics Park, Shajing Subdistrict，Bao'an District, Shenzhen, China

Training Site: Maintenance Training Room on the Fourth Floor, Shenzhen Century Cloud Core Technologies Ltd.
